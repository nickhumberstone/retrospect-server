// Script to be run once 11th response of the day is submitted
// Process:
// - 11th, not 10th query because you want each of those 11 notified to be able to see 10 other responses (not their own!)
// - Triggers on 11th response, and tries to pull all the expopushtokens. If user's dont have expopushtokens, they just won't be included in the pool
