Commands for setup

npm run dev
This will get the app running on port 3030

Run your docker instance on port 3306

lt --port 3030 --subdomain {set the subdomain} (you'll need to make sure this is set in the env file of the client side)
This will expose port 3030 so that you can test with Android devices. Without it you can only test in the browser at localhost:3030

You will need to use the schema.sql file to get your MySQL instance set up. This is currently not included for security.
